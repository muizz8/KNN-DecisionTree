In the Python code presented in the Jupyter notebook, I utilized several essential packages for data analysis and machine learning. 🐍 The code begins by importing NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualizations. 📊 To enhance the performance of the machine learning models, I imported preprocessing from scikit-learn, enabling data preprocessing and normalization. The %matplotlib inline magic command ensures that the Matplotlib plots are displayed inline. 📈

The core machine learning functionalities are implemented using scikit-learn. I applied the KNeighborsClassifier for k-nearest neighbors classification and DecisionTreeClassifier for decision tree classification. 🤖 The code incorporates preprocessing once again to ensure data consistency. To evaluate the models, I used metrics from scikit-learn, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of their performance. 📉

Additionally, the code includes a table visualization specifically tailored for KNN and decision trees. 🌲 This visualization aids in understanding the models' outcomes and contributes to the overall interpretability of the machine learning process. The Jupyter notebook provides a holistic approach to data analysis, preprocessing, model implementation, and result visualization. 👩‍💻
